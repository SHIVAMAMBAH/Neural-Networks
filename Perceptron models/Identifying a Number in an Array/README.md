This is a perceptron model used to find whether a number is present in an array or not.  
we made an array of four numbers and one of the numbers in the array is 1 and all are zero.  
And we need to find whether the number is present in the array or not.

We used the following datset
- [1,0,0,0]
- [0,1,0,0]
- [0,0,1,0]
- [0,0,0,1]

  And initialised the weights to random values.  
  We used the Rosenblatt learning rule as our backpropogation algorithm.  
  And trained the model to find out new weights.  
  The accuracy of the model is almost 100%. If we remove the TOLERANCE from the model, then it will be 100%.
